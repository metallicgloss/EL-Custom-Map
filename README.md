# ELGC-Custom-Map
This contains the VMF and compiled BSP file for a map that was created a very long time ago for a Garry's Mod community called ELGCommunity that has since closed. The website can still be found [here](https://www.metallicgloss.com/projects/elgcommunity/ "ELGCommunity")

The map is not in a very player-ready state with some materials missing and not being too well optimised. If you wish to mess with this further or change things, feel free!
